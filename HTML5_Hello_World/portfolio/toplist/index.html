    		I Never Liked You is a graphic novel by Canadian cartoonist Chester Brown (pictured). The story first ran between 1991 and 1993 in Brown's comic book Yummy Fur, and was published in book form in 1994. It deals with the teenage Brown's introversion and difficulty talking to others, especially members of the opposite sex—including his mother, to whom he is unable to express affection even as she lies dying in the hospital. The story has minimal dialogue and is sparsely narrated. The drawings are amongst the simplest in Brown's body of work—some pages consist only of a single small panel. The uncomplicated artwork of his friend and fellow Toronto cartoonist Seth inspired him to simplify his own. I Never Liked You was the last work of Brown's early autobiographical period. The book appeared amid an early-1990s trend in autobiographical alternative comics, and Brown was one of a prominent trio of Toronto-based autobiographical cartoonists, with Seth and Joe Matt. It was well received, and its influence can be found in the work of cartoonists such as Jeffrey Brown, Ariel Schrag and Anders Nilsen. (Full article...)
